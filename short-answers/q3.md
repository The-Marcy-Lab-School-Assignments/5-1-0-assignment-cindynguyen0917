 This is 99% right and I'm gonna nit-pick a bit, but only cause you this is going to make you that much better of the incredible developer you already are!

```js
class User {

    static #followers = [] // you used `:` instead of `=` this will yell at you.

    constructor (name, age) {
        this.name = name; // this is not the worst, but below you use `username`, this is where consistency is key. It could be confusing to someone if you have usernames and names but do not have a method that are explicit to it. Technically you could say that the name is the username, just add a comment so that whoever is looking at the code knows why you made this decision. 
        this.age = age;
    }

    addFollower(username) {
        User.#followers.push(username)
        return username
    }

   static getFollowers() {
    return [...User#followers]
   }
}
```
