# Question

What is the difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are created? What is the difference between how they are used?

# Answer
Class methods/properties are static meaning that there is only one copy which is shared amongst instances however they belong strictly to the class. Therefore class methods can only be accessed to in reference to the class. These types of methods are used for utility purposes that do not require instance-speific data. Otherwise, methods/properties are given to instances that are constructed from classes-- there will be a copy of each method for each instance. These methods are behaviors that paired with data that comes from an instance being constructed.

You are so close here, but there is an inaccuracy in your answer:
"methods/properties are given to instances that are constructed from classes-- there will be a copy of each method for each instance."

 Instance methods/properties are defined for each instance created from the class. When the instance is created, each instance of the class has its own copy of the properties of the class. As for the methods, the instances are given the instruction on where to look for said methods. This prevents the need to make a copy of the methods for each instance created, which is memory efficient.
