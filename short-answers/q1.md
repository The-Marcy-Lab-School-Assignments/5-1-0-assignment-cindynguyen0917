# Question

What is the difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are created? What is the difference between how they are used?

# Answer
Class methods/properties are static meaning that there is only one copy which is shared amongst instances however they belong strictly to the class. Therefore class methods can only be accessed to in reference to the class. These types of methods are used for utility purposes that do not require instance-speific data. Otherwise, methods/properties are given to instances that are constructed from classes-- there will be a copy of each method for each instance. These methods are behaviors that paired with data that comes from an instance being constructed.
